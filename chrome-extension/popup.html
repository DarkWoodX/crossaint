		<b>To start using this extension, 
		you need to open the <a href='https://chat.openai.com/chat' target=_blank>ChatGPT home page</a></b>.
		
		Once you are logged in, a box will display at the top right corner of your screen with a 'START' button.
		Click START to start talking.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		This extension allows you to talk to ChatGPT with your microphone, using Google Chrome's voice recognition API.
		Then, when your browser receives the reply, it is read out loud with a voice of your choosing.
		<br /><br />
		&bullet; When the box's bottom border is <b style='color:red'>red</b>, your microphone is listening<br />
		&bullet; When the box's bottom border is <b style='color:green'>green</b>, the bot is talking<br />
		&bullet; Access the settings by clicking the settings icon: change voice/language, bot talking speed, and more.

	<h1>Having trouble getting it to work?</h1>
	
	<p>
		1. This extension is only designed for Google Chrome desktop browser. Not Opera, not Vivaldi, not Edge: only Chrome, sorry. 
		This is due to current limitations of API support.
		
		<br /><br />
		
		2. What to do if the computer isn't recognizing text when you speak? 
			Did you make sure to give permission to use your microphone?
			Is the microphone recording volume high enough?
			Check this 
			<a href='https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/demos/speech.html' target=_blank>speech recognition test page</a>.
			If the speech recognition isn't working on that page, then it won't work on Talk-to-ChatGPT.
			Also, for Mac users, make sure your laptop's lid isn't in a closed state 
			(because of <a href='https://thehackernews.com/2018/10/apple-macbook-microphone.html' target=_blank>this</a>).
			
		<br /><br />

		3. What to do if the bot's voice is scrambled, jammed, or not working at all?
			Try opening the settings and changing the bot's voice to a different option. Also make sure the talking speed is set to 1.
			Sometimes, voices listed in the text-to-speech API don't work correctly, for some reason.
			
		<br /><br />
		
		4. What if it worked well for a bit, and suddenly nothing works correctly anymore? 
		In that case, try restarting your browser.
